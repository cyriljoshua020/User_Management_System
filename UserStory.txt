The Project is completely based on the Both Frontend and Backend, In Backend Java SpringBoot and Database as MySQL, In Frontend use the Angular framework and Connect both get the output. 

My System requirement:
Technology: Java SpringBoot(Backend) + Angular (Frontend) + Database(MySQL)
IDE & Tools: VSCode for Front end(Angular), IntelliJ for Backend(Java) + API Testing(Postman) +  Terminal for Database(MySQL)
OS: MacOS 26.1
Technology Versions: openjdk version "17.0.17" 2025-10-21 LTS + mysql  Ver 9.2.0 for macos15 on arm64

User Story:
Topic: User Management System

Initially the login and signUp should be displayed in the browser

Roles: Admin and User

Admins Responsibility:
1. Admin can login by username and password(He should be unique and can promote anyone as Admin)
2. He can See all the users, can add multiple users, Can update the specific user by UserID, Can see specific user by userID, and Delete the user by userID
3. For admin, If update, delete or added any thing, The Audit should be shown to new page(For i.e. The user Harish has deleted or updated etc...)
4. If admin delete any user, It should be get alert where Delete or cancel.

User Responsibility:
1. User Can Login by username and password(Only it should be opened by user credentials)
2. He can View them details, Update them details.


Application Workflow(Implementation):
Data should be deliver from the MySQL DB, I can check whether the data has happened or not by the terminal MySQL server. The main business logic should be Implemented in the SpringBoot by Java, The API HTTP methods of GET,PUT,POST,DELETE should be properly aligned in the specific Packages and the business logic should be implemented in the Inside service > ServiceImpl(For Each). Give the API endpoint's in the Angular application post started the backend server to get the data from the MySQL database server by the business layer. Frontend path should start the server in the webpage to shown the application.

Note: 
1. Main Web validations should be implemented by both user and Admin
2. If Login is going to do, Click Login, Sign up is going to do Click sign up in Dashboard(Which is initial page)
3. Angular version should be above 17 and it should be Standalone application.

Json Format:

{
  "username": "Vidhya",
  "password": "Vidhya@123",
  "fullName": "VidhyaLakshmi",
  "email": "vidhu020@gmail.com",
  "adminSecret": ""
}

-------    ---------      -------   -------  ----  ----  ----

For sign up with admin, Use this code - SUPERADMIN123

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Http Methods:

1. POST - http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup → create admin1 (with adminSecret)
2. POST - http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup → create harish (normal user) >>
3. POST - http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login → login as admin1 (confirm role: ADMIN) >>
4. GET  - http://localhost:8080/api/users → see both users >>
5. PUT  - http://localhost:8080/api/users/2 → update harsh >>
6. PUT  - http://localhost:8080/api/users/2/promote?performedBy=admin1 → make harish an admin >>
7. DELETE - http://localhost:8080/api/users/2?performedBy=admin1 → delete harish >>
8. GET  - http://localhost:8080/api/audit-logs → verify logs created. >>

User Management System - Complete Implementation Guide
Project Overview
Build a full-stack User Management System with role-based access control (Admin and User roles) using Angular 17+ (standalone), Spring Boot, and MySQL.
Initial Application State

The application should display a Dashboard page with two options: Login and Sign Up
This is the landing page when users first access the application


Role Definitions and Responsibilities
ADMIN Role
Authentication:

Admin logs in using unique username and password credentials
Admin accounts are unique and can promote other users to Admin role

User Management Capabilities:

View All Users - Display a list of all registered users
Add Users - Create multiple new user accounts
View Specific User - Retrieve and display details of a user by UserID
Update User - Modify user information by UserID
Delete User - Remove user by UserID with confirmation alert

Audit Trail:

All admin actions (add, update, delete) must be logged in an audit system
Display audit logs on a separate dedicated page
Audit log format: "User [username] has been [created/updated/deleted] by Admin [admin_username] on [timestamp]"

Delete Confirmation:

Before deleting any user, show an alert dialog with "Delete" and "Cancel" options
Only proceed with deletion if "Delete" is confirmed

USER Role
Authentication:

User logs in using their username and password credentials
Access is restricted to user-specific features only

Self-Management Capabilities:

View Own Details - Display their personal information
Update Own Details - Modify their personal information


Technical Architecture
Database Layer (MySQL)

Store all user data, credentials, roles, and audit logs in MySQL database
Verify all database operations through MySQL terminal/command line

Backend Layer (Spring Boot with Java)

Implement all business logic in Spring Boot
Follow proper package structure:

Controllers - Handle HTTP requests and define REST API endpoints
Services - Define business logic interfaces
ServiceImpl - Implement business logic for each service
Repositories - Database interaction layer
Models/Entities - Data models



REST API Endpoints Required:

POST /api/auth/login - User/Admin login
POST /api/auth/signup - User registration
GET /api/users - Get all users (Admin only)
GET /api/users/{userId} - Get specific user by ID
POST /api/users - Create new user (Admin only)
PUT /api/users/{userId} - Update user by ID
DELETE /api/users/{userId} - Delete user by ID (Admin only)
GET /api/audit - Get audit logs (Admin only)
POST /api/admin/promote/{userId} - Promote user to admin (Admin only)

Frontend Layer (Angular 17+ Standalone)

Use Angular 17 or higher in standalone mode (no NgModules)
Consume backend REST APIs to fetch and manipulate data
Start development server to display the application in browser

Required Pages/Components:

Dashboard - Landing page with Login and Sign Up buttons
Login Page - Authentication form
Sign Up Page - User registration form
Admin Dashboard - Admin-specific interface with user management features
User Dashboard - User-specific interface to view/update own details
Audit Log Page - Display all admin actions (Admin only)


Validation Requirements
Frontend Validations (Both Admin and User):

Username: Required, minimum length, no special characters
Password: Required, minimum 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number
Email: Required, valid email format
All form fields: Proper error messages for invalid inputs
Disable submit buttons until form is valid
Real-time validation feedback as user types

Backend Validations:

Duplicate username check during signup
Role-based authorization for protected endpoints
Validate all incoming request data
Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages


Application Flow

User visits the application → Dashboard page loads with "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons
New User Path:

Click "Sign Up" → Navigate to registration page
Fill form and submit → Data saved to MySQL via Spring Boot API
Redirect to login page after successful registration


Existing User Path:

Click "Login" → Navigate to login page
Enter credentials and submit → Authenticate via Spring Boot API
If Admin: Redirect to Admin Dashboard
If User: Redirect to User Dashboard


Admin Actions:

All CRUD operations on users
Every action creates an audit log entry
Audit logs viewable on separate page


User Actions:

View and update own profile only




Key Implementation Notes

Ensure proper role-based route guards in Angular (Admin routes protected)
Implement JWT or session-based authentication
Store user role and authentication state in frontend
All database changes must be verifiable through MySQL terminal
Follow RESTful API best practices
Implement proper error handling on both frontend and backend
Use Angular reactive forms for better validation control


Expected Outcome: A fully functional user management system where Admins have complete user management capabilities with audit tracking, and Users can manage their own profiles, all backed by MySQL database and Spring Boot REST APIs, displayed through an Angular 17+ standalone application.
